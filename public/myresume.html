    <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>My career began as a Naval Aviation Electrician. I excelled in both system<br/>
            troubleshooting and as a team leader focused on training and development. My<br/>
            sector achieved a 30% reduction in work backlog and a 50% increase in employee<br/>
            qualifications. I pursued experience in the automated logistics industry as a<br/>
            maintenance supervisor, in the oil and gas industry as a Rig Electrician, in<br/>
            medical manufacturing as a senior mechanic, and today as a field service engineer<br/>
            on solid state laser CNC machines. My greatest strengths are troubleshooting, working<br/>
            to meticulous level of detail, and building strong team relationships.<br/>
